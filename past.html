                <p>
                  While the 1857 uprising was centered in India, its aftermath
                  changed British policy and the political landscape in South
                  Asia. It set the stage for organized political movements and
                  later debates about representation and separate political
                  identity for Muslims.

                <p>
                  On December 30, 1906, Muslim leaders met in Dhaka and formed
                  the All-India Muslim League with the goal of protecting Muslim
                  political rights and promoting social welfare. This
                  organization later became the primary vehicle of the demand
                  for Pakistan.

                <p>
                  The years before independence saw major constitutional
                  debates: the Government of India Acts, the rise of regional
                  parties, and increasing communal tensions. Muslim thinkers and
                  leaders argued for safeguards and political space for Muslims
                  across British India.

                <p>
                  On March 23, 1940, the Muslim League adopted the Lahore
                  Resolution (often called the Pakistan Resolution). It called
                  for autonomous states in the north-western and eastern zones
                  of India where Muslims were in the majority — a milestone in
                  the movement for a separate nation.

                <h3>1947 — Independence & Partition (14–15 August)</h3>
                <p>
                  On August 14, 1947, Pakistan emerged as an independent state
                  for Muslims of the subcontinent. Independence was accompanied
                  by large-scale migration, communal violence, and enormous
                  human suffering. The sacrifice and resilience of the people
                  shaped the first years of the nation.
                </p>
                <p>
                  <strong>Note:</strong> Independence was the start of
                  state-building — drafting constitutions, resettling refugees,
                  and establishing institutions that could serve a diverse
                  population.

                <h3>1956 — First Constitution</h3>
                <p>
                  Pakistan adopted its first constitution in 1956, becoming the
                  Islamic Republic of Pakistan. Early constitutional history was
                  difficult — political instability, changes in government, and
                  debates about federalism and rights shaped the next decade.

                <h3>Mid-century challenges & 1971</h3>
                <p>
                  The mid-20th century brought wars, political crises, and
                  social changes. The 1971 war and the creation of an
                  independent Bangladesh was a major turning point. After 1971,
                  Pakistan underwent political restructuring and constitutional
                  reform through the 1973 constitution.

                <h3>1973 — Constitution and democratic goals</h3>
                <p>
                  The Constitution of 1973 laid out a parliamentary system and
                  many civil rights. It remains the backbone of Pakistan's legal
                  and institutional framework, although it has seen amendments
                  and times of suspension during periods of martial law.

                <p>
                  Over decades Pakistan worked to expand education, build
                  infrastructure, and develop a diversified economy. Civil
                  society, culture, and a vibrant media contributed to national
                  life despite many difficulties.
